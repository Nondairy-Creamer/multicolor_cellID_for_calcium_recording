Load: loads an AML for adjusting

Crop: Click-drag-release a rectangle around the head. Removes the portion of the image not in the box
Remove Outliers: Click points sequentially to create a polygon around the neurons. Sets all other values to 0
Reset Sliders: Resets all sliders to the last saved value
Flip X,Y: In addition to flipping the labeled dimension, each flip also flips the Z dimension. Flips in this way act like physically flipping the worm, and guarantee that if the worm is facing to the left with ventral side down, it is lying on its right side.
Rotate: Rotates around the Z axi
