# Multicolor cellID for Calcium Recording
NeuroPAL worms use 3 fluorophores and a panneuronal marker to enable cell segmentation and identification. They also allow for a calcium indicator for recording cell activity. This repo combines the information from the multicolor recording to assign cell identities to the neurons in the calcium recording.

## Setup
All code is in MATLAB and has been tested in 2019b and 2020a

Install the Paninski Lab NeuroPAL software. Note that it has 2 other required packages. I suggest putting Multicolor cellID for Calcium Recording, the NeuroPAL code, and the NeuroPAL code dependencies into one folder and adding that entire folder to your MATLAB path.

Download this repo and add it to your MATLAB path

Download yamlmatlab and add it to your MATLAB path
https://code.google.com/archive/p/yamlmatlab/

**sys_config_default.yaml** contains the default values for the software. If you want to change any of the values, don't edit this file. Instead **create sys_config.yaml** and any values you add will overwrite those in the default file or create new fields. If you are working on tigressdata the default files should be fine, if you are working from a different computer you can change the default paths to save yourself time looking for the panneurona/multicolor files to load.

## Usage
#### NOTES:
* Steps 1 and 2 can be performed in parallel
* If you are only labeling multicolor data and not aligning it to calcium data, you only need to perform steps 2 and 4


### Step 0
Record multicolor and calcium data
Move the multicolor imaging folder in the calcium imaging brainscanner folder
* Only necessary if you are trying to label calcium data using multicolor data

### Step 1 - Make a Calcium Reference Image
#### S1a
Extract calcium traces in individual neurons
using the 3dbrain pipeline
https://github.com/leiferlab/3dbrain

#### S1b
Run `create_calcium_reference`
* Select the brainscanner folder or a folder containing brainscanner folders
* Will recursively search through the selected directory and create a calcium reference for each brainscanner folder it finds
* Generates **calcium_data_average_stack.mat**

Run `visualize_light`
In the GUI take the following actions
* Load the **calcium_data_average_stack.mat** into the NeuroPAL software
* Preprocessing > Artifact Removal > Manual
* Draw a region around any autofluorescence in the gut and any other oddities
* Auto-Detect

### Step 2 - Initialize Multicolor Data
#### S2a
Run `create_multicolor_adjustment_file`
* Select the multicolor folder or a folder containing multicolor folders
* Will recursively search through the selected directory and create a multicolor adjustment file fore each
* Generates **multicolor_adjustment.mat**

Run `adjust_multicolor_image`
* Select the **multicolor_adjustment.mat** file in the multicolor folder
* Generates **neuropal_data.mat**

In the GUI take the following actions:
* Crop the image before any other manipulations to increase speed.
* Attempt to crop so that the same neurons are visible in the multicolor worm as in the calcium reference. This will significantly improve assignment to the calcium recording.
* Avoid using the roll worm dial unless necessary as it requires interpolation and slows the program
* Standard orientation is to have the worm lying on its right side facing the left
* Adjust the gamma of the green channel if necessary
* Remove outliers tool will set everything inside the region to 0
* See **README_adjust_multicolor_image.md** for more info

#### S2b
Run `visualize_light`
In the GUI take the following actions
* Load the **neuropal_data.mat** from the multicolor folder into the NeuroPAL software
* Remove any artifacts not removed in Step 2a
* Auto-Detect

### Step 3 - Align the Multicolor Labels with the Calcium Recording
Run `align_tracked_multicolor_imaging`
The first two output files contain data for all the cell bodies found in the multicolor and calcium images
* Generates **neuropal_data.mat**
* Generates **calcium_to_multicolor_alignment**

The second two output files contain data for only the multicolor cells that were assigned to neurons tracked by the calcium segmentation software. If you only care about labeling cells for calcium data using these files will save you time.
* Generates **neuropal_data_trimmed.mat**
* Generates **calcium_to_multicolor_alignment_trimmed.mat**

#### Optional but recommended (
Run `check_cell_assignment` to check the assignments between multicolor and calcium imaging.
* Displays neurons that were tracked by the calcium recording segmentation software on the left
* Displays neurons segmented in the multicolor worm on the right
* Clicking on a neuron in the calcium image will highlight the neuron it is assigned to in the multicolor Recording
* Clicking on the neuron in the multicolor recording will assign it to the currently highlighted neuron in the calcium recording

### Step 4 - ID Neurons
Run `visualize_light`
#### Option 1: If you try to label all cell bodies (default)
Load **neuropal_data.mat**

#### Option 2: If you only want to label neurons tracked by the calcium segmentation
Load **neuropal_data_trimmed.mat**

#### Cell ID
In the GUI take the following actions
* Auto-ID All
Select each neuron and try to identify it using the manuals here: https://www.hobertlab.org/neuropal/
* The example data for OH15262 can be found on tigressdata at /projects/LEIFER/neuropal_example_data
* Note that there are separate manuals for NeuroPAL w and w/o GCaMP (OH15500 and OH15262)
* Whenever you finish call `update_assignment_labels` to update **calcium_to_multicolor_alignment.mat**

## Documents Glossary
#### calcium_data_average_stack.mat
Generated by `create_calcium_reference`
An average of the first n frames of the calcium recording. This is used to get the cell body locations of the calcium recording to align to the multicolor recording. File is in a format that the NeuroPAL software `visualize_light` can read. **.csv** has the cell body locations found by the NeuroPAL software and **\_ID.mat** has the cell body locations that NeuroPAL reads in.

#### calcium_to_multicolor_alignment.mat
Generated by `align_multicolor_to_calcium_imaging`

Edited by `check_cell_assignment` and `update_assignment_labels`

This is the final output of this pipeline. Contains:
* assignments: The link between the cell body locations in the multicolor image and the neurons tracked by the calcium extraction software
* calcium_recording: The neurons x time calcium recording that was aligned to the multicolor image
* labels: The cell ID labels (AVA, RIM, etc) for the neurons in the calcium recording
* locations: The cell body locations for both the multicolor image and the calcium recording.

#### multicolor_adjustment.mat
Generated by `create_multicolor_adjustment_file`

Edited by `adjust_multicolor_image`

Contains the multicolor data as well as the channel intensity and gamma scaling, rotation of the image, artifact removal mask, and xyz flips.

#### neuropal_data.mat
Generated by `adjust_multicolor_image`

Edited by `visualize_light` (from the NeuroPAL code)

Converts **multicolor_adjustment.mat** into a form that NeuroPAL software `visualize_light` can read and edit.

#### neuropal_data_trimmed.mat
Generated by `align_tracked_multicolor_imaging`

Edited by `visualize_light` (from the NeuroPAL code)

Same as **neuropal_data.mat** but only contains neurons tracked by the calcium segmentation software

### sys_config_default.yaml
Text file containing default variables used throughout the package. Values can be superseeded or added in the user created **sys_config.yaml**
